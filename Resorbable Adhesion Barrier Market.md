**Resorbable Adhesion Barrier Market Growth, Size, Share, Trends, Statistics Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By Region, and Forecasts 2022-2032**

The **Resorbable Adhesion Barrier Market** has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, driven by increasing surgical procedures and a growing emphasis on minimizing post-operative complications. These barriers are biocompatible and gradually degrade within the body, reducing the risk of adhesion formation during the healing process. The market is propelled by rising awareness among healthcare professionals and patients about the benefits of resorbable adhesion barriers in preventing tissue adhesions. The demand for these barriers is particularly evident in surgeries involving abdominal and pelvic organs, where adhesions can lead to complications such as bowel obstruction and infertility.

**One of the key factors fueling market growth is the surge in surgical interventions worldwide.** As surgical procedures become more advanced and intricate, the likelihood of post-operative adhesions increases. Resorbable adhesion barriers offer a promising solution by creating a temporary barrier between adjacent tissues, preventing them from sticking together during the critical healing period. This has led to a higher adoption of these barriers in various surgical specialties, including gynecology, general surgery, orthopedics, and urology.
