**Self-Expanding Metallic Stents (SEMS) Market Growth, Size, Share, Trends, Statistics Analysis Report By Type, By Application, By Region, and Forecasts 2022-2032**


The **Self-Expanding Metallic Stents (SEMS) market** has witnessed significant growth and evolution in recent years, driven by advancements in medical technology, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, and a growing aging population. SEMS are widely used in the treatment of various medical conditions, particularly in the field of gastroenterology, pulmonology, and urology. These stents are designed to expand automatically when deployed, providing a scaffold to keep narrowed or blocked vessels and ducts open, thereby improving the flow of fluids or air within the body.

**One of the key factors fueling the growth of the SEMS market is the rising incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders.** Diseases such as colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often lead to blockages in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract, necessitating the use of SEMS for effective treatment. The minimally invasive nature of stent placement procedures, coupled with the reduced recovery time for patients, has further contributed to the increasing adoption of SEMS as a preferred intervention method.
