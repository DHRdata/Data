The **sterile exam gloves market** has witnessed substantial growth in recent years, driven by a surge in healthcare awareness, increased emphasis on infection control, and growing concerns regarding cross-contamination. Sterile exam gloves are an essential component in medical settings, ensuring aseptic conditions during various medical procedures, examinations, and surgeries. The global market for sterile exam gloves is characterized by a diverse range of products, including latex, nitrile, and vinyl gloves. Each type of glove has its unique advantages, catering to specific preferences and requirements within the healthcare industry.

**Latex gloves have traditionally dominated the market, owing to their excellent elasticity and comfort.** However, the rise in latex allergies has paved the way for the increased adoption of nitrile gloves, which offer comparable performance without triggering allergic reactions.
